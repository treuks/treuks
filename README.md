# Hi, I'm Niki!

Just some random girl from **Ukraine.**

I know three humanning languages: **English, Russian, Ukrainian.**

Familiar with a whole bunch of programming languages, don't have a favourite one, I guess Crystal and TypeScript(with Deno and BunJS) are close enough.

I only post projects that are at a somewhat finished state. (which, as you can see, doesn't happen often, lol)
