# Hi, I'm Aurora!

Just some random girl from **Ukraine**, blahblahblah, copyright lololol. 

I know three humanning languages: **English**, **Russian** and **Ukrainian**. 

I would prefer for you to talk to me in ***English***.

---

Unordered list of favourite programming languages:

* **Gleam**
* **Crystal**
* **TypeScript** (Deno)
* **Rust**
  
---

I only post projects that are at a somewhat finished state (which, as you can see, doesn't happen often, lol), and I do most of them for fun and learning.

I'm not the best of programmers, please don't look at my code as an example of what you should or shouldn't do (especially if its like, really old).

---

Please remember that the only thing in life that matters is to have fun.
